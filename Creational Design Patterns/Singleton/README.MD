# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Singleton** design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Key Concepts
1. **Single Instance:** Guarantees that only one instance of a class is created.
2. **Global Access:** Provides a global point of access to the single instance.
3. **Lazy Initialization:** The instance is created only when it is needed for the first time.

## Problem Statement
In many software applications, certain resources (such as database connections, configuration settings, or logging mechanisms) should be managed by a single instance to ensure consistent behavior across the application. Creating multiple instances of such resources can lead to:

## Resource Consumption: Additional memory and CPU usage.
1. **Inconsistent State:** Multiple instances can lead to inconsistent data or failed transactions.
2. **Complex Management:** Managing multiple instances can become complex and error-prone.
The Singleton pattern solves these issues by ensuring that only one instance of a class is created and providing a global access point to that instance.

## Solution
The **Singleton** pattern involves the following steps:

1. **Private Constructor:** Make the constructor private to prevent external instantiation.
2. **Static Instance Variable:** Create a private static variable to hold the single instance of the class.
3. **Static Access Method:** Provide a public static method to access the instance. This method creates the instance if it does not already exist and returns the existing instance.
