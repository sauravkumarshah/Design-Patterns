# Prototype Design Pattern in Java

## Overview

The **Prototype** design pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to copy existing objects without depending on their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when object creation is complex or time-consuming, as it lets you create a clone of an object rather than creating a new one from scratch.

## Problem

Imagine you have a complex object (e.g., a `Dragon` or `Goblin` in a game) with many attributes and possibly private fields. If you need to create an exact copy of this object, doing so manually can be cumbersome and error-prone. Additionally, direct copying from the outside might not be possible due to access restrictions.

The Prototype pattern solves this problem by allowing objects to clone themselves, ensuring that the client code remains independent of the specific class of the objects being copied.

## Solution

The Prototype pattern suggests the following approach:

1. **Prototype Interface:** Define a common interface (`Monster`) for all classes that can be cloned. This interface should declare a `clone()` method that returns a copy of the object.

2. **Concrete Prototypes:** Implement the prototype interface in concrete classes like `Dragon` and `Goblin`. These classes will override the `clone()` method to return a new instance of themselves with the same attributes.

3. **Client Code:** The client can then clone objects without worrying about their specific classes. This is demonstrated in the `PrototypePatternDemo` class, where both `Dragon` and `Goblin` objects are cloned.

## Code Structure

- **`com.example.prototypepattern.prototype`**
  - `Monster`: The prototype interface that declares the `clone()` method.

- **`com.example.prototypepattern.monsters`**
  - `Dragon`: A concrete implementation of the `Monster` interface, representing a dragon.
  - `Goblin`: A concrete implementation of the `Monster` interface, representing a goblin.

- **`com.example.prototypepattern`**
  - `PrototypePatternDemo`: The client code demonstrating the use of the Prototype pattern.

## Example Code

### Prototype Interface

```java
package com.example.prototypepattern.prototype;

public interface Monster extends Cloneable {
    Monster clone();
}
